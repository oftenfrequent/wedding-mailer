# wedding-mailer

I built this simple app to send invitations, reminders, and eventually thank you notes to those who were invited to my wedding. I have done my best to open-source it in a digestible way.

There is an [accompanying blog post](https://medium.com/@oftenfrequent/send-automated-personalized-emails-for-free-fc4709663b36?sk=325f10a7078447354ce7ece8fafb1016) so that you can follow along in order to hook things up to your own personal gmail account and send emails from your terminal.
